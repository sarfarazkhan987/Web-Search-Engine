My project with FCA was interesting and the coursework was challenging. The highlight for me was living in Italy, learning creative ways to manage the language barrier, and meeting some of the greatest people I know. In the end, this program led me to my current job at FCA, for which I am extremely thankful.” Ashley Lehman – BASc in Mechanical Engineering [2013]; MASc in Automotive Engineering [2015] 195 Number of Mechanical Engineering Graduates (2017) 93.2% Employment rate of graduates 2 years following degree completion (OUGS Engineering, 2014) Common Industries for Mechanical Engineering Graduates Academia and research Education Engineering Energy/utilities sector Government Industry and manufacturing Logistics and operations Patent/intellectual property law Career Tracks* Academia Agricultural equipment Automotive Aerospace Energy generation Forestry Heavy industry equipment Logistics Manufacturing Marine equipment Medical devices Military/defence Mining Nuclear Petroleum Plastics Railway Steel/Metal production Telecommunications Transportation * Additional education and/or training required for some of the above careers.
