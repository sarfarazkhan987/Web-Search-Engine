Alumni to recognize their own Thursday Nov 13th, 2019 As chief executive officer of the John McGivney Children’s Centre, UWindsor alumna Elaine Whitmore (BScN 1988) oversaw its growth into a state-of-the-art facility helping children and youth with special needs to reach their full potential. Whitmore retired this spring after 17 years in that role, using her background in nursing and health background to propel the organization to a leader in caring for clients and families. Her passion and leadership have earned her recognition from the University of Windsor Alumni Association, which will present her with its Award of Merit during its annual general meeting Thursday, Nov. 14. Helen Vasilic (BSc 1975, B.Ed 1976), a former educator and volunteer coach and official in track and field, will also receive this honour. The Alumni Ambassador Award, which recognizes mid-career alumni who have reached significant achievements in their professional life, community and volunteer work, and as a UWindsor ambassador, will be presented to Laurie Tannous (BA 1999, JD 2002). Tannous, an attorney specializing in immigration, serves as a special advisor to the Cross-Border Institute. She shares her expertise and insight to promote co-ordination among law enforcement, community and global partners. In addition to the above awards, English professor Johanna Frank will receive the Excellence in Mentoring Award, and the Odyssey Award for alumni early in their careers will go to Marla Coffin (BA 2009), Stacey Robert-Tobin (BA 2006, B.Ed 2013, M.Ed 2014) and Jennifer Seedu (BComm 2013). Thursday’s Annual General Meeting and Awards Presentation will begin at 5 p.m. in the Alumni Auditorium, CAW Student Centre. Find additional information and register on the event website.
