Undergraduates go tropical for course credit Jun 8th, 2017 After two weeks in Costa Rica with the dean of science, 11 undergraduate students earned two science course credits in the new Global Perspectives of Science program. “The fact that I, as UWindsor’s dean of science, could take a small group to the jungles and beaches of Costa Rica to study natural hazards for bona fide course credit, is a testament to our faculty to student ratio of 1:15,” says Chris Houser, who is also a professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. From May 7 to 21, undergraduates enrolled in Environmental Field Methods and the Natural Hazards of Costa Rica spent their time working with Dr. Houser on his research into rip currents. On both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica, the students mapped the rip currents and surveyed beach users to understand the extent of the rip current hazard in the country and to develop new strategies to warn tourists of hazards. The students also spent time deep in the heart of the Children’s Eternal Rainforest to get a perspective of the jungle that few visitors to Costa Rica ever experience. Second-year earth and environmental science student Nathanyel Guimond went on the trip and says he cannot believe what he accomplished in just two weeks, from identifying rip tides to going through testimonials of an actual beach drowning in a mock trial. “Dr. Houser taught us a lot through his passion and love for studying rip currents. I also got to feel the power of a rip current and understand the potential dangers they pose to people,” says Guimond. “These courses are also about kick-starting opportunities for my future. This year Costa Rica, who knows where I’ll be next year?” Houser says he is committed to providing studies in science with a global perspective. This was the first summer courses were offered as part of the new travel program, which he plans to grow in coming years. “In its first year, 2 per cent of our UWindsor science undergrads have now studied abroad and we have a goal of doubling that number next year,” he says. “Next year we hope to add new programs to the remote areas of the arctic and northern Europe in addition to more offerings in Costa Rica.” Brianna Lunardi Chris Houser Nathanyel Guimond Strategic Priority: Promote international engagement Provide an exceptional undergraduate experience Academic Area: Science Earth & Environmental Sciences share tweet save In Memoriam Campus mourns death of retired psychology professor Meyer Starr Internal Job Postings Nov 15, 2019 - Receptionist - Student Health, Counselling and Wellness '8' in the Department of Student Health, Counselling & Wellness Nov 13, 2019 - Serials & Bindery Control Clerk '6' in the Law Library (Temporary until approximately June 5, 2020) Nov 12, 2019 - Secretary to the Head '7' in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Internal/External Job Postings Nov 14, 2019 - Temporary Part Time ESL Instructor in the Centre for English Language Development (up to 24 hrs/week for the approximate period Jan 9 to April 10, 2020) Nov 12, 2019 - Application Server Administrator (Peoplesoft) Tentative Classification "VI" in the Department of IT Services Nov 7, 2019 - Accessibility Manager in the Office of Human Rights, Equity and Accessibility Nov 7, 2019 - Team Leader - Chemical Control Centre Classification "VII" in the Chemical Control Centre / Health & Safety Department IT Services Resolved: Spam Email Nov 13, 2019 Resolved: Network Maintenance Sep 12 6:00-7:30am Sep 11, 2019 Intermittent Printing Issues Aug 1, 2019 Blackboard unavailable Thu Aug 01 5-7am Jul 31, 2019 Network Maintenance - July 25th - Update Jul 25, 2019 Project Notifications Biology Building-326A & 326B Upgrades/Installation of Dual Duct Mixing Boxes, November 19-21, 2019, 8:30am-4:30pm CAW Student Centre/Vanier Hall-Semi Annual Kitchen Fire Support System Inspections, December 16-18, 2019, 8:00am-4:00pm Chrysler Hall Tower/University Computer Centre/Essex Hall -Chemical Control Centre/Energy Conversion Centre-Semi Annual Fire Suppression Inspections, December 16-18, 2019, 8:00am-4:00pm Lambton Tower-G115 Water Leaks Investigation, November 11-15, 2019, 8:30am-4:30pm St. Denis Fieldhouse/Human Kinetics/Forge Fitness/Stadium-Lancer Sport and Recreation Centre (LSRC) Project (Parking/Access), November 11, 2019-March 31, 2020, 7:00am-5:00pm More share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
