It took a big turn in my fourth year as I did my practicum and thesis at Windsor Regional Hospital in Pathology. I was amazed and inspired by the career of a Pathologists’ Assistant. Shortly after graduating in 2010 with Honours - Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, I was hired as a Pathologist’s Assistant at Windsor Regional Hospital.” Iain Macri – BFS (Honours) in Forensic Science with Molecular Biology/Biochemistry Specialization [2010] Common Industries for Forensic Science Graduates Academia: Diverse forensic fields, legal studies, and health sciences Business: Research and analysis, human resources, project management, data and fraud management Corrections and psychological services Education and counselling Forensic sciences/evidence analysis Government services Law and law enforcement Police services Security agencies: Public and private Social service and community agencies Career Tracks* Behaviour profiler Border services officer Case management officer Consultant Crime scene officer Criminologist Customs inspector Database librarian Detective Doctor Document specialist Forensic biologist Forensic chemist Forensic psychologist Immigration services Internet security analyst Journalist Lab technician Law enforcement officer Lawyer Legal consultant Pathologist assistant Policy analyst Professor Research co-ordinator Serologist Surveillance specialist Teacher * Additional education and/or training required for some of the above careers.
