The competition requires students to develop a satellite that can take a photo from space when commanded to do so by amateur radio operators around the world. It is intended to advance space education in Canada, inspiring students to pursue science and engineering educations and careers. The satellites will undergo full launch and space environmental qualification testing, with the goal of launching the winning satellite into orbit. In Quebec, teams conducted 2.5-hour presentations to a panel of industry experts. Read More Adjunct professor to head ozone research body Oct 30th, 2019 A UWindsor adjunct professor will be the first Canadian to lead an international educational and scientific organization dedicated to ozone technology. Saad Y. Jasim was inaugurated as the president of the International Ozone Association during its World Congress and Exhibition, held Oct. 20 to 25 in Nice, France. He will start his two-year term as president in January 2020. “It will be my duty to provide education and knowledge to different sectors in the world and make sure that knowledge transfer is the aim of our work,” says Dr. Jasim, who has served as a UWindsor adjunct professor since 1996. “I would like to make a difference. That is what I believe I was able to do in places like Windsor and Walkerton, Ont.” Jasim introduced ozone to drinking water in Windsor in 2001 when he served as the Windsor Utilities Commission’s director of water quality and production. Since then, the City of Windsor has repeatedly won Best Tasting Water in a competition organized by the Ontario Water Works Association. In 2004, Jasim designed an ozone system in Leamington for a 14-acre greenhouse, recycling more than 25,000 gallons of discharged water.

Experts in intelligent transportation, network optimization, big data, sharing economy, risk management and operations and supply chain management delivered keynote talks and shared their findings during paper presentations. “The conference proved an excellent platform to exchange ideas and introduce new models, methods and innovative applications,” says conference chair, Dr. Guoqing Zhang, an industrial engineering professor and director of the Supply Chain and logistics Optimization Research Centre. “Many attendees appreciated the opportunities to engage in in-depth discussions with distinguished researchers.” Read More Graduating students tackle real-world problems Jul 29th, 2019 Jeff Bilek, Larry Sandhu, Aaron Marson and Connor Holowachuk display their fitness-based wearable Friday, July 26, 2019 in the Ed Lumley Centre for Engineering Innovation. More than 100 industry and community members came to the University of Windsor Friday to learn more about student engineering projects that have real-world applications and the potential to advance technology. The fourth-year capstone projects ranged from fitness-based wearables, autonomous vehicle technologiesand sensor systems for monitoring greenhouses to the optimization of the Chatham Water Pollution Control Plant and building energy retrofitting. "Our project allowed us to explore a variety of practical solutions to real-world problems,” says Olivia Byrne, whose team placed second in the Water Environment Association of Ontario's annual student design competition for its optimization of the Chatham Water Pollution Control Plant. “Coming up with a competitive solution required intense dedication and organization.” Read More Hyperloop team puts Windsor on world stage Jul 25th, 2019 Overwhelming support from the community, a shout-out from the prime minister and a chance to pick Elon Musk’s brain has left the uWinLoop team feeling charged and driven to compete again in next year’s SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition. The team of University of Windsor and St. Clair College students made it to the final round of the international competition, but was not one of the four teams out of 21 to be selected to test its pod due to stringent safety requirements. "Our team worked closely with SpaceX engineers leading up to the competition day,” says Solange Rennie, the team’s business lead. “We were provided with advice and guidance in order to continuously improve our pod, which we plan to utilize for next year’s competition.” Read More Rocketry students reach new heights in international competition Jul 24th, 2019 A team of mechanical engineering students placed fifth in the world's largest intercollegiate rocket engineering competition.
