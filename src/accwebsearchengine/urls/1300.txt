Pride prize to incentivize charity participation Nov 13th, 2019 The #UWinProud campaign is again looking to combine school spirit and holiday spirit with a prize to encourage participation in the campus Adopt-a-Family effort. A program of the Windsor-Essex Children’s Aid Foundation, Adopt-a-Family collects gifts for local children and youths. UWindsor offices and individuals may choose to sponsor a family as large as two parents with four kids or as small as a single parent and child. Also available for sponsorship are youths on extended care — individuals over the age of 16 years old attending school while living independently. As part of its Windsor Proud spirit campaign, the Office of Student Experience is providing an incentive to participate, by awarding the department with the highest total donation a free coffee break and some #UWinProud swag to go with it. A winner will be announced, on Dec. 5, once the donations are all received. Find details on the contest website. To sign up as a sponsor, email Sabina Howell, administrative assistant in the Office of Public Affairs and Communications, who co-ordinates the campus campaign, at Sabina.Howell@uwindsor.ca.
