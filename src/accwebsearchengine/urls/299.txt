My degree was as unique as they come—balancing History with Biological Sciences—but from day one, I was encouraged that my diverse interests were a strength. The History department gave me every opportunity to succeed, from office hours spent going line-by-line through my papers teaching me to write like a historian to a hands-on research assistantship. The skills I gained are not abstract. I use them every day in my career as a history editor—a job I owe to my professors who invested in me.” Sharon Hanna – Bachelor of Arts and Science (Major Concentration: History; Minor Concentration: Biology) “In retrospect, studying history at the University of Windsor provided me with the foundational skills on which to continue growing, as a student and, perhaps more importantly, as a human being. I use skills such as critical analysis, collecting and assessing evidence, and articulating arguments orally and in writing every day in my personal and professional life. One thing is for certain: in today’s social and political climate, these skills are at a premium.” Cal Murgu – BA (Honours) in History [2014] Common Industries for History Graduates Academia: University libraries, professorships Arts and Culture: Cultural societies and initiatives History: Archives, historical sites and societies Education: Teaching, corporate training Government and Civil Service Law Marketing Media and Communication: Publishing, web content Museum and Institution: Galleries, public exhibitions Public relations Career Tracks* Archivist Border services officer Communications specialist Financial researcher Government official Heritage interpreter Historical projects co-ordinator Information manager Journalist Judicial clerk Lawyer Librarian Museum curator Political aide Post-secondary administrator Project manager Public policy advisor Publishing editor Publishing sales representative Research co-ordinator Scriptwriter/screenwriter Teacher Tourism consultant TV/radio research assistant * Additional education and/or training required for some of the above careers.
