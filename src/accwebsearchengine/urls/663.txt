Faculty of Education students make news in China Jul 16th, 2019 Teacher candidates from the University of Windsor made news in China for their enthusiastic efforts to learn elements of that country’s culture during a three-month study trip. The students, participants in the Teacher Education Reciprocal Learning Program, received instruction in traditional dance and textile techniques listed by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage. From March 16 to June 17, the group visited Chinese universities and K-12 schools in Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Suzhou. Members attracted reporters from the local newspaper and national broadcasters to document them learning from pupils of Changlang Primary School in Suzhou. B.Ed student Taylor Pare said the first-hand experiences proved very educational. “I have learned so much about how to be a teacher just being in China,” Pare said. “The Reciprocal Learning Program is extremely worthwhile not only for those who like to travel around the world, but also for the people who enjoy learning different cultures.” The program, an important phase of a SSHRC Partnership Grant Project by professor Shijing Xu and Michael Connelly, promotes exchange of future educators between the University of Windsor and Southwest University China. It is sponsored by the Mitacs Globalink Research Award and the University of Windsor Strategic Priority Fund.
