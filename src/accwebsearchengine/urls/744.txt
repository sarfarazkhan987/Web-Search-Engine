UWindsor researchers aim to improve lives of cardiac patients Nov 7th, 2019 Finding ways to get more cardiac patients participating in rehabilitation programs is the focus of a new research initiative co-founded by a UWindsor kinesiology professor. “Cardiac patients around the world underutilize cardiac rehabilitation, despite evidence that these programs offer physical and mental health benefits,” said Cheri McGowan, a clinical cardiovascular and exercise physiologist in UWindsor’s Faculty of Human Kinetics. Dr. McGowan is leading a cross-border team comparing cardiac rehabilitation models of care throughout the Great Lakes Region. Called the Great Lakes Cardiac Rehabilitation Consortium, it includes fellow UWindsor kinesiology professor Kevin Milne, and experts from the cardiac rehabilitation programs at Hotel-Dieu Grace Healthcare, the Lawson Health Research Institute (St. Joseph’s Health Care London), the Henry Ford Medical Group (Henry Ford Health System) in Detroit, and the University of Michigan (Michigan Medicine) in Ann Arbor. The consortium members include cardiologists, scientists, exercise specialists, physiologists, students and statisticians. They know there are barriers that keep cardiac patients from accessing programs and adhering to them. Their goal is to find solutions to help more patients access cardiac rehabilitation and improve long-term adherence to the healthy behaviours these programs try to instill in participants. “To our knowledge, the consortium is the first of its kind in North America and lays a foundation for long-term international collaboration and impact, said McGowan. “This work will help optimize cardiac rehabilitation and potentially improve the lives of thousands in our individual communities and beyond.” Cardiac disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Cardiac rehabilitation programs have proven to reduce hospitalizations and lower death rates. Funding for the consortium’s early work comes from a Partners in Research grant from the University of Windsor and Hotel-Dieu Grace Healthcare. ─ Sarah Sacheli Cheri McGowan Kevin Milne Strategic Priority: Pursue strengths in research and graduate education Academic Area: Human Kinetics Research share tweet save In Memoriam Campus mourns death of retired psychology professor Meyer Starr Internal Job Postings Nov 15, 2019 - Receptionist - Student Health, Counselling and Wellness '8' in the Department of Student Health, Counselling & Wellness Nov 13, 2019 - Serials & Bindery Control Clerk '6' in the Law Library (Temporary until approximately June 5, 2020) Nov 12, 2019 - Secretary to the Head '7' in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Internal/External Job Postings Nov 14, 2019 - Temporary Part Time ESL Instructor in the Centre for English Language Development (up to 24 hrs/week for the approximate period Jan 9 to April 10, 2020) Nov 12, 2019 - Application Server Administrator (Peoplesoft) Tentative Classification "VI" in the Department of IT Services Nov 7, 2019 - Accessibility Manager in the Office of Human Rights, Equity and Accessibility Nov 7, 2019 - Team Leader - Chemical Control Centre Classification "VII" in the Chemical Control Centre / Health & Safety Department IT Services Resolved: Spam Email Nov 13, 2019 Resolved: Network Maintenance Sep 12 6:00-7:30am Sep 11, 2019 Intermittent Printing Issues Aug 1, 2019 Blackboard unavailable Thu Aug 01 5-7am Jul 31, 2019 Network Maintenance - July 25th - Update Jul 25, 2019 Project Notifications Biology Building-326A & 326B Upgrades/Installation of Dual Duct Mixing Boxes, November 19-21, 2019, 8:30am-4:30pm CAW Student Centre/Vanier Hall-Semi Annual Kitchen Fire Support System Inspections, December 16-18, 2019, 8:00am-4:00pm Chrysler Hall Tower/University Computer Centre/Essex Hall -Chemical Control Centre/Energy Conversion Centre-Semi Annual Fire Suppression Inspections, December 16-18, 2019, 8:00am-4:00pm Lambton Tower-G115 Water Leaks Investigation, November 11-15, 2019, 8:30am-4:30pm St. Denis Fieldhouse/Human Kinetics/Forge Fitness/Stadium-Lancer Sport and Recreation Centre (LSRC) Project (Parking/Access), November 11, 2019-March 31, 2020, 7:00am-5:00pm More share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
