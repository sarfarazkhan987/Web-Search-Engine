Coffee and cake to show appreciation for anti-violence efforts Nov 13th, 2019 Members of the campus community are invited to join UWindsor’s Bystander Initiative for a Coffee and Cake event. The Bystander Initiative is an important part of the University of Windsor’s ongoing commitment to fostering an environment that is free from sexual violence. Achieving this goal requires engaging the entire campus community and the ongoing support of administrators, faculty, staff, and students, says acting co-ordinator Frankie Cachon. “We are very proud of the University of Windsor’s national leadership in addressing sexual violence and we want to thank our campus for the tremendous support of our efforts to prevent sexual violence,” said Dr. Cachon. The Bystander Initiative, now in its second year of its campus-wide programming, seeks to activate students to take personal and social responsibility for the prevention of sexual violence. The end goal is a campus with zero tolerance of all forms of sexual violence. The event is an opportunity to thank the many stakeholders who make Bystander programming possible and to celebrate collaborative efforts to make the campus safer for all. Stop by the CAW Student Centre for complimentary coffee and cake today — Wednesday, Nov. 13 — from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. or while supplies last.
