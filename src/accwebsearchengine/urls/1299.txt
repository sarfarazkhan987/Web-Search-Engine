In the intervening decades, the articles on such topics as alchemy and religion gave way to the works of such renowned writers as Marshall McLuhan, Joyce Carol Oates, and winners of Governor General awards, Pulitzer prizes, the Order of Canada, and other accolades for their literary work. An event at Biblioasis bookshop Thursday, Nov. 14, celebrates 50-plus years of The Windsor Review. The family of the late Eugene McNamara, the journal’s first editor and founder of UWindsor’s creative writing program, will be on hand to accept a memorial photo commemorating The Windsor Review’s history. The latest edition, edited by UWindsor English professor André Narbonne and published online for free public access, is a selection of works published over the journal’s six decades. The list of authors in what Narbonne calls the “special, retrospective issue,” reads like a who’s who of contemporary literature — poets laureate and iconic essayists, novelists, and authors of short stories. “I wanted it to be representative of the journal Eugene McNamara created in 1965… a collection of important writing,” said Dr. Narbonne. Narbonne is the journal’s fiction editor. He guest-edited the current edition, carefully curating a collection of creative writing, interviews, poetry, and visual art. “It’s such an easy project for me to get involved in,” said Narbonne. “These are foundational things for writers.” Thursday’s event begins at 7 p.m. Biblioasis is located at 1520 Wyandotte St. E. ─Sarah Sacheli Andre Narbonne Academic Area: Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences English share tweet save In Memoriam Campus mourns death of retired psychology professor Meyer Starr Internal Job Postings Nov 15, 2019 - Receptionist - Student Health, Counselling and Wellness '8' in the Department of Student Health, Counselling & Wellness Nov 13, 2019 - Serials & Bindery Control Clerk '6' in the Law Library (Temporary until approximately June 5, 2020) Nov 12, 2019 - Secretary to the Head '7' in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Internal/External Job Postings Nov 14, 2019 - Temporary Part Time ESL Instructor in the Centre for English Language Development (up to 24 hrs/week for the approximate period Jan 9 to April 10, 2020) Nov 12, 2019 - Application Server Administrator (Peoplesoft) Tentative Classification "VI" in the Department of IT Services Nov 7, 2019 - Accessibility Manager in the Office of Human Rights, Equity and Accessibility Nov 7, 2019 - Team Leader - Chemical Control Centre Classification "VII" in the Chemical Control Centre / Health & Safety Department IT Services Resolved: Spam Email Nov 13, 2019 Resolved: Network Maintenance Sep 12 6:00-7:30am Sep 11, 2019 Intermittent Printing Issues Aug 1, 2019 Blackboard unavailable Thu Aug 01 5-7am Jul 31, 2019 Network Maintenance - July 25th - Update Jul 25, 2019 Project Notifications Biology Building-326A & 326B Upgrades/Installation of Dual Duct Mixing Boxes, November 19-21, 2019, 8:30am-4:30pm CAW Student Centre/Vanier Hall-Semi Annual Kitchen Fire Support System Inspections, December 16-18, 2019, 8:00am-4:00pm Chrysler Hall Tower/University Computer Centre/Essex Hall -Chemical Control Centre/Energy Conversion Centre-Semi Annual Fire Suppression Inspections, December 16-18, 2019, 8:00am-4:00pm Lambton Tower-G115 Water Leaks Investigation, November 11-15, 2019, 8:30am-4:30pm St. Denis Fieldhouse/Human Kinetics/Forge Fitness/Stadium-Lancer Sport and Recreation Centre (LSRC) Project (Parking/Access), November 11, 2019-March 31, 2020, 7:00am-5:00pm More share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
