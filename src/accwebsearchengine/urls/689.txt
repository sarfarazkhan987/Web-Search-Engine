The competition requires students to develop a satellite that can take a photo from space when commanded to do so by amateur radio operators around the world. It is intended to advance space education in Canada, inspiring students to pursue science and engineering educations and careers. The satellites will undergo full launch and space environmental qualification testing, with the goal of launching the winning satellite into orbit. In Quebec, teams conducted 2.5-hour presentations to a panel of industry experts. Cole Nadalin, vice-president and business lead of the University of Windsor Space and Aeronautics Team (WinSAT), says the early results bode well for the school’s first-ever entry. “Placing first in Canada for our CubeSat design is an incredible achievement for the University of Windsor,” he says. “Having collected valuable information from the competition judges, the team now needs to fabricate and test a functioning satellite.” Team president Atilla Saadat says the multidisciplinary pursuit requires students from many disciplines, including engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, business, and earth sciences. “If you are a UWindsor undergraduate or graduate student interested in joining WinSAT — especially for your capstone project — check out https://winsat.ca/apply to read the requirements and submit your application,” says Saadat. Nadalin says members hope to bring local expertise in advanced manufacturing to national attention, and will seek in-kind donations of materials and services. “We greatly appreciate all contributions,” he says. “Via as many channels as are possible, we are hoping to gain the support of Windsor's manufacturing skills and knowledge base to showcase everything that Windsor has to offer from an engineering standpoint.” Find details of WinSAT’s needs at www.winsat.ca/sponsorship. 2019 News Archive Academic Area: Engineering Civil and Environmental Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Industrial Engineering Mechanical, Automotive & Materials Engineering — Published on Nov 1st, 2019 share tweet save Follow Us: Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Youtube share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
