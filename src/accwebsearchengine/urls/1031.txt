Wellness Outreach Office Information for Faculty and Staff Frequently Asked Questions UWindsor Home Student Counselling Centre Welcome Welcome The Student Counselling Centre at the University of Windsor provides registered students free, confidential mental health counselling delivered by trained mental health professionals. Students in crisis will be provided support and counselling. Although attending university can be an exciting and dynamic experience, it can also present some challenges. Outside of the obvious academic pressures, students may have to deal with stresses related to: Physical or mental illness (e.g., depression, anxiety) Family issues Identity confusion Time management The end of important relationships Illness or death of a loved one Moving away from home Financial concerns Sometimes coping with one or more of these stresses can prove to be overwhelming. The professional staff of the Student Counselling Centre are here to help! The University offers short-term counselling and therapy services to students who may be experiencing a number of emotional and or behavioural difficulties during the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer semesters. If a student has a need for long-term counselling, the University may provide referrals to assist the student in accessing resources in the community.
