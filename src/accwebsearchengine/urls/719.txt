With pride, we watched our faculty and students be recognized for their research achievements, successful grant capture, presentations and publications. We also experienced another successful Kinesiology Research Day, and had a solid student representation in events across campus (e.g., University of Windsorâ€™s UWin Undergraduate Conference, BCN Colloquium). I look forward to leveraging the strengths and experience of each individual researcher to create an even stronger collective research group over the years to come.
