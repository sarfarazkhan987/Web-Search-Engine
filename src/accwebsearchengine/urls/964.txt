Silver screen to showcase cinematic short stories Nov 4th, 2019 Education professor Cam Cobb and B.Ed student Chris Di Staulo teamed up to create a 10-minute documentary that will screen during the Windsor International Film Festival as part of its “WIFF Local Shorts” collection, at the Chrysler Theatre at 8 p.m. Monday, Nov. 4. Their entry, Buskin’ in the Subway, follows a day in the life of Don Stevenson, a 70-something Toronto busker. Stevenson shares stories from a life that saw him cross paths with Etta Jones, Etta James, B.B. King, Janis Joplin, Santana, Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, and more. Monday’s screening will feature 12 films, including several with a UWindsor connection: film student Braunte Petric’s Defender, which describes the work of Windsor law professor Julie Macfarlane on behalf of litigants who represent themselves in court; student Yongjun Liu’s A Normal Evening, depicting the struggles of trying to be happy in Canada on the eve of Chinese New Year; Essence of Death, by MBA grad Matthew Sabelli, a fable on life, the afterlife, and what it means to exist; alumnus Francesco Loschiavo’s post-apocalyptic tale Into the Grey; and two by student Gemma Eva — the thriller Rough Love, and with classmate Calum Hotchkiss, the period piece The Rabbit and the Snare. The Chrysler Theatre is located at 201 Riverside Dr. W. Find more information, including a list of the local shorts, on the festival website.
