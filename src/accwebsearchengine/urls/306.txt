I spent my third year living in Spain, studying at the Universidad de Valladolid, and travelling Europe – truly an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience. While abroad, I also tutored two native Spanish girls in English. Between the tutoring abroad and the teaching practicum I took in my fourth year, I was able to reaffirm that teaching is my career path.” Shaun Collins – BA (Honours) in Modern Languages with Year Abroad Spanish Option [2018] 90.2% Employment rate of graduates 2 years following degree completion (OUGS Humanities, 2014) Common Industries for Modern Languages Graduates Academia: Advanced social research Arts and culture Business: Research and analysis, human resources Education: Teaching, language teaching Government: Multilingual positions Immigration and community integration Law and law enforcement Media, marketing, journalism, and publishing Research agencies: Public and private Career Tracks* Administrative assistant Archivist Border services Business advisor Communications specialist Curator Editor Historical consultant Human resources manager Immigration services Industry instructor Journalist Language advisor Lawyer Librarian Marketing manager Media analyst Museum director Professor Public official Public policy advisor Public relations officer Reporter Research co-ordinator Speech pathologist Teacher Television/Radio analyst Translator * Additional education and/or training required for some of the above careers.
