Residence gives you the chance to gain independence while having the support of residence staff. And an added bonus for international students is how close you will be to the International Students Centre (ISC) which is located in one of our residence halls. You will make friends with the students across the hall, have the ease of an already furnished room, and donâ€™t worry about learning how to cook because our meal plan has you covered.
