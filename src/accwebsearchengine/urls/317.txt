Through my education, I was fortunate enough to meet a number of likeminded young artists, with whom I would collaborate for years to come. I have also witnessed the true dedication of SoCA’s faculty members, some of whom I have remained in contact with for many years. Visual Arts at Windsor is a unique program and I am proud to call myself an alumnus."
